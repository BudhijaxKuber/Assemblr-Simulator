# Assemblr-Simulator

Based on given ISA

Q1: Assembler:
Program an assembler for the aforementioned ISA and assembly. The input to the assembler is
a text file containing the assembly instructions. Each line of the text file may be of one of 3
types:
● Empty line: Ignore these lines
● A label
● An instruction
● A variable definition
Each of these entities have the following grammar:
● The syntax of all the supported instructions is given above. The fields of an instruction are
whitespace separated. The instruction itself might also have whitespace before it. An
instruction can be one of the following:
● The opcode must be one of the supported mnemonic.
● A register can be one of R0, R1, ... R6, and FLAGS.
● A mem_addr in jump instructions must be a label.
● A Imm must be a whole number <= 255 and >= 0.
● A mem_addr in load and store must be a variable.
● A label marks a location in the code and must be followed by a colon (:). No spaces are
allowed between label name and colon(:)
● A variable definition is of the following format:
var xyz
which declares a 16 bit variable called xyz. This variable name can be used in place of
mem_addr fields in load and store instructions. All variables must be defined at the
very beginning of the assembly program.

The assembler should be capable of:
1. Handling all supported instructions
2. Handling labels
3. Handling variables
4. Making sure that any illegal instruction (any instruction (or instruction usage) which is not
supported) results in a syntax error. In particular you must handle:
a. Typos in instruction name or register name
b. Use of undefined variables
c. Use of undefined labels
d. Illegal use of FLAGS register
e. Illegal Immediate values (more than 8 bits)
f. Misuse of labels as variables or vice-versa
g. Variables not declared at the beginning
h. Missing hlt instruction
i. hlt not being used as the last instruction
You need to generate distinct readable errors for all these conditions. If you find any
other illegal usage, you are required to generate a “General Syntax Error”. The
assembler must print out all these errors.
5. If the code is error free, then the corresponding binary is generated. The binary file is a
text file in which each line is a 16bit binary number written using 0s and 1s in ASCII. The
assembler can write less than or equal to 256 lines.
Input/Output format:
● The assembler must read the assembly program as an input text file (stdin).
● The assembler must generate the binary (if there are no errors) as an output text file
(stdout).
● The assembler must generate the error notifications along with line number on which the
error was encountered (if there are errors) as an output text file (stdout). In case of
multiple errors, the assembler may print any one of the errors.
Example of an assembly program
var X
mov R1 $10
mov R2 $100
mul R3 R1 R2
st R3 X
hlt
The above program will be converted into the following machine code
1001000100001010
1001001001100100
1011000011001010
1010101100000101
0101000000000000

Q2: Simulator:
You need to write a simulator for the given ISA. The input to the simulator is a binary file (the
format is the same as the format of the binary file generated by the assembler in Q1. The
simulator should load the binary in the system memory at the beginning, and then start
executing the code at address 0. The code is executed until hlt is reached. After execution of
each instruction, the simulator should output one line containing an 8 bit number denoting the
program counter. This should be followed by 8 space separated 16 bit binary numbers denoting
the values of the registers (R0, R1, ... R6 and FLAGS).
<PC (8 bits)><space><R0 (16 bits)><space>...<R6 (16 bits)><space><FLAGS (16 bits)>.
The output must be written to stdout. Similarly, the input must be read from stdin. After the
program is halted, print the memory dump of the whole memory. This should be 256 lines, each
having a 16 bit value
<16 bit data>
<16 bit data>
.....
<16 bit data>
Your simulator must have the following distinct components:
1. Memory (MEM): MEM takes in an 8 bit address and returns a 16 bit value as the data.
The MEM stores 512bytes, initialized to 0s.
2. Program Counter (PC): The PC is an 8 bit register which points to the current instruction.
3. Register File (RF): The RF takes in the register name (R0, R1, ... R6 or FLAGS) and
returns the value stored at that register.
4. Execution Engine (EE): The EE takes the address of the instruction from the PC, uses it
to get the stored instruction from MEM, and executes the instruction by updating the RF
and PC.
The simulator should follow roughly the following pseudocode:
initialize(MEM); // Load memory from stdin
PC = 0; // Start from the first instruction
halted = false;
while(not halted)
{
Instruction = MEM.getData(PC); // Get current instruction
halted, new_PC = EE.execute(Instruction); // Update RF compute new_PC
PC.dump(); // Print PC
RF.dump(); // Print RF state
PC.update(new_PC); // Update PC
}
MEM.dump() // Print memory state

Q3: Floating-Point Arithmetic:
CSE112_Floating_point_representation: NO sign bit, 3 exponent bits, and 5 mantissa bits.
● In the registers, only the last 8 bits will be used in computations and initialization for the
floating-point numbers.
Modify the assembler and simulator to include arithmetic operations for floating-point numbers
of the form(precision) given above.
Specifically, include the following functions:
